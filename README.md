# Weather Now

The Weather Now is a web application that provides real-time weather information for different cities. It allows users to search for a specific city or choose from a list of common places to view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The application leverages the Weather API provided by RapidAPI to fetch weather data for the requested cities.

- **Temperature:** The current temperature is displayed prominently on the page, along with the minimum and maximum temperature for the day.
